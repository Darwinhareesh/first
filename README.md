# first
This is my first git repository.
I'm a ug student at vignan university.
In this repository I want to show case my project known as hotel management system which is done by using python tkinter.
Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Developed an intuitive graphical user interface using Tkinter, ensuring ease of navigation and a pleasant user experience.

Booking and Reservation System: Implemented a robust booking system that allows users to check room availability, make reservations, and view booking details.

Room Management: Created functionalities for room categorization, assignment, and status tracking. Users can easily view and manage the availability of rooms in real-time.

Billing and Invoicing: Integrated a billing system that automates the calculation of charges, including room rates, additional services, and taxes. The system generates invoices for guests during check-out.


Outcome:
This project not only honed my proficiency in Python programming and Tkinter GUI development but also provided a practical understanding of software design principles and database management. The Hotel Management System serves as a testament to my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications that address real-world operational needs.
